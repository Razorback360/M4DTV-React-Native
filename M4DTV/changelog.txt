__**Changelog:**__

- added subtitles 
- a little ui changes here and there
- you can now change subtitle size and color from the menu
- you can now change how much time on each seek from the menu. (ex: 10s, 30s, 1m)
- changed the media player
- you can now change the media player themes from the options menu
- you can now stare at the media's backdrop while waiting for the media to load 
- added a button to forcefully sync the subtitles incase they lag or freeze


__**What "Bugs" to not report:**__

- The media player's menus stack on each other. Will be fixed later. Just deal with it for now.
- Quality having no use on the stream. Will be added later for 4K once we have a big enough library and 4k streaming implemented
- Trailer button not working. Youtube is a dick in terms of videos, i need to figure out how to get a direct link instead of a yt link to get it to work.
- Auto play next episode. This will come at the same time as the site getting the autoplay feature.
- Subtitles takes a little delay to appear after seeking(1s - 15s). Please try to use the sync now button if it took longer. Please report if it takes more than that and the sync button didn't fix it.
