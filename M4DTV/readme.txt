Subtitles work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

however there is still some issues and i am probably going to rewrite the whole script so all that effort for nothing lmao(yeah its pretty funny im 100% laughing not crying)

the main issue i am facing is performance: it takes an stupidly long time to load the subtitles. now i am not sure what exactly causes that much delay. whether it's the fetching and coverting the subtitle file, or the for loops used for syncing(my guess is the latter) but either way it is unusable especially since i have to rerun the whole code everytime i fast forword/rewind.(more on that in the Subtitles.js)

In conclusion, i wanted to give you an update on the situation and i heavily documented the subtitles.js in case you want to take a look. i will now create a new branch and start from square one. hopefully this time i can think of a better way to do it
